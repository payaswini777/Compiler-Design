Lex Codes

Lab-1:

C program to construct a DFA with ∑ = {0, 1} that accepts the languages ending with “01” over the characters {0, 1}
C program to accept set of all strings over binary alphabet containing even number of 0’s and even number of 1’s.

Lab-2:

Implementation of Lexical analyzer using C

Lab-3:

Identification of Vowels and Consonants
count number of vowels and consonants
Count the number of Lines in given input
Recognize strings ending with 00
Recognize a string with three consecutive 0’s

Lab-4:

Implementation of lexical analyzer using LEX.

Lab-5:

Lexical Analyzer for a language.

Lab-6:

Lab-7:

Predictive parser. Write a C program for the computation of FIRST and FOLLOW for a given CFG.

Lab-8:

Predictive Parser. Implement non-recursive Predictive Parser for the grammar.

Lab-9:

Shift Reduce Parser. Implementation of Shift Reduce parser using C .
